## What make's some code "good"?

Code needs to work, that's key. But what makes the code written by a guru better than the code written by a newbie?

**When a expert writes code it is easy to read, easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to modify.**

You will sometimes write code that is just for you, you will only use it once, and you will never see it again. Python is good for these one-off scripts. But more often you will be writing code that another person will need to read. In that case, you are not writing code for yourself.

**You will always understand your own code, but your goal is to make it easy for other people to pick up and use.**
