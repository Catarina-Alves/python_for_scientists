## What make's some code "good"?

Code needs to work, that's key. But what makes the code written by a guru better than the code written by a newbie?

**When a expert writes code it is easy to read, easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to modify.**

You will sometimes write code that is just for you, you will only use it once, and you will never see it again. Python is good for these one-off scripts. But more often you will be writing code that another person will need to read. In that case, you are not writing code for yourself.

**You will always understand your own code, but your goal is to make it easy for other people to pick up and use.**

#### PEP8

## Comments

## Code Organization

#### Functions, Methods, and Classes

#### Will your code be imported?

## Code Repositories

Software works best when it is shared. Software shared between multiple people, developed and improved by everyone becomes better, easier to use, faster, and much more clear.

The best way to share code is via a code repository. This is a central place where we can store code for later, save different versions, make updates, and track the changes to everything. If you're not using a code repository, your scripts and programs are just little text files on your computer, waiting to be forgotten.

The two most popular code repositories are Git and SVN.

## The Git Primer

I have already written a short introduction to Git, it is on GitHub [here](https://gist.github.com/theJollySin/7a2ee80c05d073996d16).
