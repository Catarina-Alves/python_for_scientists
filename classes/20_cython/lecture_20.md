# Cython - a pxd example

Okay, first things first. Cython is a big topic. It would take 6-9 lectures to cover it completely. So we won't be doing that. But it would also be a dis-service to skip the topic entirely. The approach we will take here is to show *one example of how to use Cython*. This is not, by any means, the only way to use Cython. This is just an example of one possible approach.

This lecture shows an example of how to speed up pre-existing code using Cython, without changing the code itself. You just add an extra `*.pxd` file for each `*.py` file, and deal with the new Cython build process.

Again, this is not the only way to use Cython, but it is a simple example.

NOTE: Cython is a way of applying the [type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) from the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) to Python. So, if you are not familiar with [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran), or some other [strongly-typed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing), this will all seem a little magical to you. These are good languages, and worth learning, but outside the scope of this course.
