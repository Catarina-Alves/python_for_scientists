# Python Functions

## Simple Functions

Write a simple function that:

1. takes in two numbers and returns their product.
2. takes in a numbers and returns its absolute value.
3. takes in a postive integer and adds all of the positve integers from zero to the input.
4. takes no input, but uses `from random import randint` to return the result of a random dice roll.
5. takes an input `list` of numbers and returns the average.
6. takes a `list` of integers and returns a list containing only the odd numbers.
7. takes in an integer `n` and returns a dictionary where the keys are the numbers `1` through `n` and the values are the square of the key.
8. takes in a `list` of values and returns a `set` of those values.
9. takes in a `list` and returns `True` if the value *isn't* in the list, and `False` otherwise (call your function `not_in`).
10. takes in three sets and returns the union of all three.
11. takes in a dictionary and returns a sorted list of its keys.

## Functions with Keyword Arguments

Write functions to fill the following goals, using at least one keyword argument:

1. Print "Hello, X!", where the default value of X is "World".
2. Given a `list` of integers, print all that are evenly divided by X (default value 2).
3. Extend a set of values (default empty set), by another set.
