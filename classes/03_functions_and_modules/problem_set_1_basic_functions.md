# Python Functions

Don't scroll down too far, or you'll see the solutions.

## Simple Functions

Write simple functions that does the following that:

1. return the product of two numbers
2. returns the absolute value of a number
3. takes in a number and adds all of the positve number from zero to the input
4. uses `from random import randint` to return the result of a random dice roll
5. takes an input list of numbers and returns the average
6. takes in a lits of integers and returns a list containing only the odd numbers

## Keyword Arguments

Write functions to fill the following goals, using at least one keyword argument:

    1. Print "Hello, X!", where the default value of X is "World".
    2. Given a list of integers, print all that are evenly divided by X (default value 2).
    3. Extend a set of values (default empty set), by another set.

    
## Nested Functions

The first two numbers in the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) are: 1 and 1. Every number after that is the sum of the last two elements in the sequence.

Write a function `fibonacci` that returns the nth Fibonacci Number, with another function inside of it (`recursion`) that calls the `fibonacci` function twice.
