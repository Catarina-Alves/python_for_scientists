# Databases with SQLITE3

First off, there are a lot of different kinds of databases: SQL, MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, etc.  And because each type of database needs a different interface, there are a lot of different libraries for dealing with databases in Python. Check [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseInterfaces) for a nice listing of the most popular database interfaces in Python.

We are going to discuss `sqlite3` because it is the only database library that comes standard with Python. It is also pretty great, working well with reasonably small, "light" databases.

Most databases are [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29) or [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_service) that are run on your computer. But one of the major features of `sqlite3` is that there is no server/service, it is just a file with all the data inside. This is particularly handy for smaller databases and for databases you want to included in an application.
