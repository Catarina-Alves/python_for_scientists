# Databases with SQLITE3

First off, there are a lot of different kinds of databases: SQL, MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, etc.  And because each type of database needs a different interface, there are a lot of different libraries for dealing with databases in Python.

We are going to discuss `sqlite3` because it is the only database library that comes standard with Python. It is also pretty great, working well with reasonably small, "light" databases.
