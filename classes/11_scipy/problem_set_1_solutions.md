# Stats with SciPy

## Reading the Data

#### 1. Use `DictReader` from `import csv` to read the CSV data file into a list of dictionaries, where each row is a dictionary.

    >>> import csv
    >>> f = open('london_2012_olympic_athlete_data.csv', 'r')
    >>> dict_reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    >>> athletes = []
    >>> for row in dict_reader:
    ...     athletes.append(row)
