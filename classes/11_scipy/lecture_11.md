# Statistics with SciPy

SciPy is an amazingly useful library for scientists and engineers of all kinds. In this class we will just be using the portions of SciPy that deal with statistics and data analysis.

## Installing SciPy

Like most of the libraries used in our "special topics" lectures, SciPy does not come standard with Python and will have to be installed. Please check the official [SciPy Stack Install Guide](http://www.scipy.org/install.html). For Linux and Mac, the installation is merely a single line of `apt-get`. For Windows, pre-built installers are provided.

## Basic Statistics

Interestingly, most of the functions found in this sub-section can also be found in NumPy. But that won't be true for most topics in this lecture.

#### min, max, mean, median

 * Coming Soon

#### std, var, cov, corrcoef

 * Coming Soon

## Distributions

 * Coming Soon

## Density Functions

 * Coming Soon

## Least-Square Fitting

This is actually just a small piece of the optimization tools available in SciPy. But it is a common thing we might want to do, and serves as a good introduction to the SciPy optimization tools.

## Root Finding

Again, this is just a small piece of the optimization toolset in SciPy.

## Interpolation
