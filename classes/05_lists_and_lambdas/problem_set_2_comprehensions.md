# Comprehensions

#### List Comprehensions

Use a single-line list comprehension to create the following list:

1. A list of all the odd numbers from 17 to 34.
2. A list of all the odd numbers in: `years = [1492, 1776, 1812, 1945, 1969, 1984, 1985, 2001, 2015]`
3. The square of all numbers from 4 to 14.
4. The number of times each digit occurs in the sequence: `pi = "141592653589793238462643383279502881"`. (Hint: str.count('0'). Hint: your answer should be a list 10 items long, one for each digit 0 through 9.)

#### Dictionary Comprehensions

Use a single-line dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary of the following terms.

1. Using `zip`, where the keys are `keys = ["a", "b", "c"]` and the values are `values = [1, 2, 3]`.
2. A dictionary where the keys are 1 through 10 and the values are the cube of the keys.
3. A dictionary where the keys are 1 through 10 and the values are True if the key is odd and False if even.
