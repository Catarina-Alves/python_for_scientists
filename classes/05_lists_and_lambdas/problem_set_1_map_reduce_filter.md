# Map, Reduce, Filter

#### Lambda

In order to use `map` and `filter` you're going to have to get used to `lambda` functions.  Create lambda functions to do the following things:

1. Find the square of a number.
2. Find the cube of a number.
3. Convert a Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius. (Hint: (5/9)(F - 32))
4. Add two numbers.
5. Multiple two numbers.
6. Join two strings, by placing the space character between them.

#### Map

Using only a single line `map` statement, create a list of the following items:

1. The cubes of the numbers 1 through 33.
2. All numbers less than 1000 that are evenly divisible by 3.
3. Convert these temps from Fahrenheit to Celsuis: `temps = [-42.0, -10.9, 0.0, 20.7, 32.0, 42.0, 101, 273, 320]`
4. The square of all even, two-digit numbers.

#### Filter

Using only a single `filter` statement, solve the following puzzles:

1. What positive, odd numbers less than 1000 are evenly divisible by 7 and 13?
2. What integers less than 10,000 are both: the square of another integer and evenly divisible by 2?
3. How many positive, even numbers less than 1,000,000 are evenly divisible by 99?

#### Choose Your Own Adventure

Use `map` and/or `filter` (and maybe `sum`) to solve the following puzzles:

1. Find all the numbers evenly divisible by 3, below 100.
2. Calculate the sum of all the even numbers from 2 to 222.
3. Calculate the sum of the first five powers of seven.
