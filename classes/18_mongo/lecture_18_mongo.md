# MongoDB

Unlike most databases, MongoDB is a "NoSQL" database. Where most databases are based around related tables of data, Mongo allows you to store data in any old format you want. This leads to much more natural data representations. It also means your whole workflow will be very different from our a typical SQL-like database. There are advantages and disadvantages to this, but Mongo is easier to get use than most database systems, and scales well.

Because Mongo is so different, in this lecture we will cover both the Mongo syntax and the Python MongoDB API, separately.


## Installation

For installation instructions for the MongoDB database server and client look [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/).

To install the Python MongoDB API, try using [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html). Anaconda is Python packaged with hundreds of tools and libraries, and it is a great learning tool.

    conda install mongodb
