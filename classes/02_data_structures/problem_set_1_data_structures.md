# Python Data Structures

### Lists

1. Initialize a list called "boys" with the elements: "Fred", "George", "Percy", "Ron".
2. Initialize a list called "girls" with elements: "Giney".
3. Print both lists.
4. Print the first element in "girls".
5. Find two or three ways to print the last element in "boys".
6. Add the element "Charles" to the "boys" list.
7. Add the "boys" and "girls" together, and save the results as a list called "weasleys".
8. Use the `.sort()` method to sort the "weasleys" list into alphabetical order.

#### Sorting

In general, sorting a list of items is a classic, but difficult computational tast. However, it has been studied so thoroughly, that there are two methods built right into Python to do this for you:

    lst = [7, 4, 3, 1, 8, 4, 333, -1234]
    lst.sort()
    print(lst)
    
    lst = [7, 4, 3, 1, 8, 4, 333, -1234]
    sorted(lst)

So, what is the difference between `sort` and `sorted` above?

### Dictionaries

1. Create an empty dictionary named "tardis".
2. Add a key/value pair to tardis of "Doctor"/"Who".
3. Add a key/value pair to the tardis dictionary of "Dalek"/"Evil".
4. Print the tardis dictionary. Print the keys and the values in tardis.
5. Change the value of "Dalek" to "Exterminate"
6. Print tardis (in two different ways).
7. Save the Doctor! Remove the "Dalek" key from the dictonary.
8. Print tardis.

### Tuples

This will be short, because tuples are so much like lists.

1. Create a tuple called "months" containing the words "January" and "February".
2. Add "March" to the "months" tuple.
3. Change "January" to "June".
4. Return the first element in "months"
5. Return the last element in "months" in two or three different ways.

### Sets

1. Create a empty sets called "insects".
2. One-at-a-time, add these elements to insects: "6 legs", "exoskeleton", "3-part bodies", "small", "lay eggs"
3. Create a new set called "spiders" that starts off including the elements: "8 legs", "spin webs", "2-part bodies", "small", "lay eggs"
4. Print both sets.
5. Find the intersection of both sets.
6. Determine if either set is a subset of the other.
7. Add "not cuddly" to the spider set, and print.
8. Remove the "not cuddly" from the spider set, and print.
