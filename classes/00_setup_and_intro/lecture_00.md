## How to install Python?

Python should be easy to install on basically all home computers and laptops. There are many different versions and flavors of Python, but for the purposes of this class we want to install Python v2.6 or v2.7. I also encourage you to try Python v3, it should not matter greatly which you pick.

The installation procedure depends on what operating system you have installed:

#### Windows

#### Mac OSX

#### Linux
