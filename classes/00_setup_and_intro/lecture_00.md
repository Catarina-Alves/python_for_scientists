# Setup and Introduction

## How to install Python?

Python should be easy to install on basically all home computers and laptops. There are many different versions and flavors of Python. This class will be built around Python v2.7, but you will probably be fine using anything above Python v2.5.

The installation procedure depends on what operating system you have installed. As always, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) has a great description of how to install for the three different operating systems.

 * [Windows](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/)
 * [Mac OS X](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/)
 * [Linux](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/)

(NOTE: The above guide also explains how to install SetupTools, Pip, and VirtualEnv. While these are great tools worth learning, and I highly encourage it, they are not necessary for this course.)

## What is Python?

Python is a [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language), [interpretted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language), [dynamically-typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language) computer programming language whose goal appears to be to make code as easy to write as possible. The Python programming language is [free](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31717/what-do-the-phrases-free-speech-vs.-free-beer-really-mean/) and [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source#Computer_software).

### Comparing Python to other languages

To understand Python it is probably best to consider how Python differs from other programming languages. This is a good chance to explain those esoteric terms used above.

#### High-Level

A low-level language is a list of instructions for a computer's processor, telling it exactly what (extremely basic) calculations to perform. The lowest level languages are not even readable by humans. Slightly more high level than those languages is machine code, which is code written for the operating system (because an operating system gives us the ability to write programs that can be shared between many different computers with different hardware. Slightly more high-level than that are assembly languages, which are technically human-readable, but extremely opaque and hard to use. Next come languages like C and Fortran. These languages are extremely fast and perform very well. But you still have to think about how the computer itself works to write code: you have to deal with pointers and arrays and stack overflows explicitly. Finally, the highest level languages try to abstract away how the computer works and let your write code as simply as possible to deal with your concepts, not your hardware. Python and Java are among these languages
