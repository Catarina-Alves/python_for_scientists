# Setup and Introduction

## How to install Python?

Python should be easy to install on basically all home computers and laptops. There are many different versions and flavors of Python, but for the purposes of this class we want to install Python v2.6 or v2.7. I also encourage you to try Python v3, it should not matter greatly which you pick.

The installation procedure depends on what operating system you have installed. As always, The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python has a great description of how to install for the three different operating systems.

 * [Windows](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/)
 * [Mac OS X](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/)
 * [Linux](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/)

(NOTE: The above guide also explains how to install SetupTools, Pip, and VirtualEnv. While these are great tools worth learning, and I highly encourage it, they are not necessary for this course.)
