# Data Analysis with Pandas

 * Coming Soon

## Installation

Like most of the libraries used in our "special topics" lectures, Pandas does not come standard with Python and will have to be installed. Please check the official [SciPy Stack Install Guide](http://www.scipy.org/install.html). For Linux and Mac, the installation is merely a single line of `apt-get`. For Windows, pre-built installers are provided.

#### Anaconda

Consider installing [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html) instead. Anaconda is Python packaged with over 100 tools and libraries that you will want (This includes Pandas and everything else we will use in this course.)
