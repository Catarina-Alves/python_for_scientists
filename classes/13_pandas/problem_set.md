# Data Analysis with Pandas - Problem Set

**I would strongly recommend doing these problems in iPython or in the standard Python interpreter.**

#### Reading in Data

1. Read in the comma-separated file "client_list.csv". Assign as variable `df1`.
2. Read in the delimted file "client_list.table". Assign as variable as `df2`.
3. Read in the fixed-width file "client_list.txt". Assign as variable `df3`
4. Read in the comma-separated file "client_list.csv", skip the first 3 rows, and ignore the header. Do not assign to variable (just return a view).
5. Read in the comma-separated file "client_list.csv". Set the column headers in all caps. Assign as variable `df`.
6. Read in the comma-separated file "client_list_practice.csv" and only extract the columns ["FIRST_NAME","AGE","EYE_COLOR"]. Do not assign to a variable.

#### Slicing a Data Set

7. Slice rows 5 through 11 of `df`. Can you provide two ways of doing this?
8. Return only the columns ['LAST_NAME','AGE','HAIR_COLOR'] for `df`. Can you provide two ways of doing this?
9. Combine problems 7 and 8: return rows 5 though 11 and columns  ['LAST_NAME','AGE','HAIR_COLOR'] for `df`. Can you provide two ways of doing this?
