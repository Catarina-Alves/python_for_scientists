# Taking the Next Step

All the material in this course so far was just too define "the rules" of Python. But writing good code means more than just knowing the rules that define a language. You can teach a six-year-old the rules to chess, but that doesn't make them the world's Grand Master. A lot of knowledge, skill, and practice are needed to earn that title. The rest of this class will be devoted to taking the next step beyond basic syntax.

## Writting Better Code

The most important thing is always that your code works. Obviously. But some software is better than others. Good code creates *less* work for you, not *more*.

**Good code is easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to modify.**

In this lecture we will introduce the methods and tools needed to write better code.

## Code Repositories

Software works best when it is shared. Software shared between multiple people, developed and improved by everyone becomes better, easier to use, faster, and much more clear.

The best way to share code is via a code repository. This is a central place where we can store code for later, save different versions, make updates, and track the changes to everything. If you're not using a code repository, your scripts and programs are just little text files on your computer, waiting to be forgotten.

The two most popular code repositories are Git and SVN.

## The Git Primer

I have already written a short introduction to Git, it is on GitHub [here](https://gist.github.com/theJollySin/7a2ee80c05d073996d16).

Of course, these class notes are stored and displayed using [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/), a free web app for your Git Repositories.
