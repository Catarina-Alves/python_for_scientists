# Taking the Next Step

## What make's some code "better"?

Step one is that your code needs to work. But what makes code written by a guru better than code written by a newbie?

**Good code is easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to modify.**

Good code will make your life easier. And it will make other people's life easier. It will create *less* work for you, not *more*. And it will create less work for other people, and they will like you for that.

In this lecture we will introduce the methods and tools needed to make better code.

## Syntax

#### The Counter Example

#### PEP8

## Comments

## Code Repositories

Software works best when it is shared. Software shared between multiple people, developed and improved by everyone becomes better, easier to use, faster, and much more clear.

The best way to share code is via a code repository. This is a central place where we can store code for later, save different versions, make updates, and track the changes to everything. If you're not using a code repository, your scripts and programs are just little text files on your computer, waiting to be forgotten.

The two most popular code repositories are Git and SVN.

## The Git Primer

I have already written a short introduction to Git, it is on GitHub [here](https://gist.github.com/theJollySin/7a2ee80c05d073996d16).

## GitHub

Of course, these class notes are stored and displayed using [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/), a free web app for your Git Repositories.
