# NumPy

NumPy is a popular mathematics library for Python. It gives you access to a wide variety of mathematical functions and data types that are useful to scientists and engineers.

NumPy is not built into the Python Standard libraries, but needs to be installed on your computer separately. You can find instructions for installing NumPy [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html).
