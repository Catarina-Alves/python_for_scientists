# Converting Matlab to NumPy

Are you a Matlab user who wants to switch to Python? That is a *great* idea. Because Python is a general programming langauge you can use to do a lot more than just Matrix algebra. You can build websites as big as YouTube, or executables that run easily on any operating system.

But the first thing you might want to do is learn to convert all your Matrix math to Python. If so, this page will give you the syntax to write all your Matrix math in both languages.

First, in Python, you will want to import the big Python math library:

    import numpy as np
