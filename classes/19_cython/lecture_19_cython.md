# Cython

Writing code in Python is fast. But the code you write isn't as fast as, say, C code. Wouldn't it be nice if Python were faster? Enter Cython. Cython allows you to easily wrap C and C++ code in Python. It also allows you to use C-like static typing syntax directly in your Python code. Cython also provides parallel processing options that are not available in normal Python code.

Cython is two things:

* a way to add C-like types to Python code, to improve performance
* a way to compile Cython code to C, so it can be compiled as an extension module


## Installation

Consider installing [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html). It will come packaged with Cython, but also a ton of other really great Python libraries.


## Compiling and Running Cython

There are several ways to compile Cython code so it can be run by Python. Cython can be:

 * compiled and run interactively from iPython
 * compiled automatically at import time
 * compiled separately by build tools like `distutils`
 * integrated into standard build systems like `make`
