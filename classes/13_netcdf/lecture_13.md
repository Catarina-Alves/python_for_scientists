# NetCDF File in Python

Scientists from all walks of life find themselves using the NetCDF file format. It is a fairly generic binary-formatted data file designed around storing arrays of data. For this reason, NetCDF files are particularly useful for modeling spatial data: meteorology, climotology, and geospatial mapping. Tools have been built to deal with NetCDF files in every popular programming language.
