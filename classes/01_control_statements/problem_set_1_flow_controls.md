# Basic Control Flow - Problems

1. Print the numbers 3 through 13 using a `for` loop and a `range` statement.
2. Print the numbers 2 through 20 using a `while` loop.
3. Using `range`, print only the odd numbers from 4 to 40.
4. Using an `if` statement inside a `for` loop, print only the odd numbers from 4 to 40.
5. Using a `while` loop and a `break`, print the numbers from 10 down to 0.
6. Using a `for` loop and a `continue`, print only the even numbers from 1 to 30.
7. Using `range` as part of a `for` loop, loop through every number evenly divsible by 5 from zero to 100. Using an `if` statement, print only the even numbers from that set.
8. Using `type`, write an `if` statement that will print a variable `x` if it is a string, but not if it is anything else.
9. Using a `for` loop, sum the even numbers from 1 to 10,000.
10. Using a `while` loop, an `if-elif` block, and the `%` operator, find the smallest number that is evenly divisible by: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12.
11. Using `range` and `while`, sum all the numbers evenly divisble by 7, from 0 to 10000.
12. Using `for` or `while` and an `if` statement, print the numbers `10` through `1`, then the string `"Blast off!"`.
13. Use a `while` loop to calculate the sum of the first 100 odd integers.
14. Use a `for` loop to calculate the 10th [Triangular Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number). The nth Triangular Number is: `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n`.
15. Using two `for` loops (one nested inside the other), print out the factorials of `10` through `1` (in that order).
16. Below is the multiplication table up to 2. Following that example, use two nested `for` loops to print the multiplication table up to 5.

        x    1    2
        1    1    2
        2    2    4
