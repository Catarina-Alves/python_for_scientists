# Basic Control Flow - Problems

 1. Print the numbers 3 through 13 with a `for` loop and a `range` statement.
 2. Print the numbers 2 through 20 with a `while` loop.
 3. Using `range`, print only the odd numbers from 4 to 40.
 4. Using an `if` statement inside a `for` loop, print only the odd numbers from 4 to 40.
 5. Using a `while` loop and a `break`, print the numbers from 10 down to 0.
 6. Using a `for` loop and a `continue`, print only the even numbers from 1 to 30.
 7. Using a `range` as part of a `for` loop, loop through every number divsible by 5 below 100. Using an `if` statement, print only the even numbers from that set.
 8. Using `type`, write an `if` statement that will print a variable `x` if it is a string, but not if it is anything else.
 9. Using a `for` loop, sum up the even numbers from 1 to 10,000.
 10. Using a `while` loop, an `if-elif` block, and the `%` operator, find the smallest number that is evenly divisible by: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12.
 11. Using `range` and `while`, sum all the numbers evenly divisble by 7, from 0 to 10000.
 12. Using `for` or `while` and an `if` statement, print the numbers `10` through `1`, then the string `"Blast off!"`.
 13. Following the example below for the multiplication table from 1 to 2, use two `for` loops to print the multiplication table from 1 to 5.

        x    1    2
        1    1    2
        2    2    4
