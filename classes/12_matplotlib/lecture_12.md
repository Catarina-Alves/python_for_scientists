# Plotting with matplotlib

Matplotlib is a standard plotting library in Python. That is, people use it all the time to make 2D or 3D informational graphics. This is not a thorough guide to everything you can do with the library. But a quick introduction to the four major kinds of plots you (as a scientist/engineer) will want to make 99% of the time. The plots are easy to make, and easy to customize. Matplotlib also allows for a dizzying amount of customization, so you can create anything from quick-and-easy plots to publication-quality plots.

## Installing matplotlib

Like most of the libraries used in our "special topics" lectures, matplotlib does not come standard with Python and will have to be installed. Please check the official [SciPy Stack Install Guide](http://www.scipy.org/install.html). For Linux and Mac, the installation is merely a single line of `apt-get`. For Windows, pre-built installers are provided.

Matplotlib is a powerful tool. But there are so many options for different ways to plot things remembering all of them would be a pain. So I cheat. [Here](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) is the cheat sheet: a wonderful collection of matplotlib examples.
