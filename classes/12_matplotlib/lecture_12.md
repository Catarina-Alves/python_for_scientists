# Plotting with matplotlib

Matplotlib is a standard plotting library in Python. It is typically used for 2D and 3D data plots, not for gaming graphics. There are so many kinds of plots one might want to make, and so many diffferent ways to customize them, that not everything can be covered explicitly here. Instead, several common types of plots will be shown, as well as common customizations. After that, references will be given for the user to create the plots of their dreams.

## Installing matplotlib

Like most of the libraries used in our "special topics" lectures, matplotlib does not come standard with Python and will have to be installed. Please check the official [SciPy Stack Install Guide](http://www.scipy.org/install.html). For Linux and Mac, the installation is merely a single line of `apt-get`. For Windows, pre-built installers are provided.

Matplotlib is a powerful tool. But there are so many options for different ways to plot things remembering all of them would be a pain. So I cheat. [Here](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) is the cheat sheet: a wonderful collection of matplotlib examples.
