> Python Open Courseware for Scientists and Engineers

Software is a tool of the modern world. For many scientists and engineers, software has become *the* tool and Python has become *the* language. This class is [free](http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/) courseware designed to get scientists and engineers up to speed on Python and productive.

### What This Class is

The purpose of this class is to provide a practical introduction to the Python language in general and more specifically to the Python libraries used every day by scientists and engineers.

### What This Class is Not

This class is not meant to provide a rigorous computer science background. To get started on that, here are three of my favorite books: [SICP](http://amzn.com/0262510871), [Intro to Algorithms](http://amzn.com/0262033844), [Code Complete](http://amzn.com/0735619670).
