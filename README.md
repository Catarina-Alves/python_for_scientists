> Python Open Courseware for Scientists and Engineers

Software is the tool of the modern world. Software is so general a tool it is used in almost every field. That means that a person who has mastered a few languages can truly do what they want. For many scientists and engineers, software has become *the* tool and Python has become *the* language. This class aims to create a totally free and open source resource for scientists and engineers to learn Python to help them in their daily work.

### What This Class is

The purpose of this class is to provide a practical introduction to the Python language in general and more specifically to the Python libraries used every day by scientists and engineers.

### What This Class is Not

This class is not meant to provide a thorough background in computer science. To get started on that, here are three of my favorite books: [SICP](http://amzn.com/0262510871), [Intro to Algorithms](http://amzn.com/0262033844), [Code Complete](http://amzn.com/0735619670).
