> Python for Scientists and Engineers

Software is the tool of the modern world. The great thing about software is that it is such a general tool is used almost everywhere. A person who masters a language or two has the ability to truly do what they want. For many scientists and engineers, software has become *the* tool and Python has become *the* language.

The purpose of this class is to provide an introduction to the Python language in general and more specifically to Python libraries used every day by scientists and engineers.

Introductory classes include:

 * [Basic Syntax](classes/01_basic_syntax/lecture_01.md)
 * [Functions and Modules](classes/02_functions_and_modules/lecture_02.md)
 * [Advanced Strings](classes/03_advanced_strings/lecture_03.md)
 * [Lists and Lambdas](classes/04_lists_and_lambdas/lecture_04.md)
 * [Object-Oriented Programming, Part 1](classes/05_object_oriented_programming_1/lecture_05.md)
 * [Object-Oriented Programming, Part 2](classes/06_object_oriented_programming_2/lecture_06.md)
 * [Taking the Next Step](classes/07_taking_the_next_step/lecture_07.md)

Topical classes include:

 * [NumPy](classes/08_numpy/lecture_08.md)
 * [matplotlib](classes/09_matplotlib/lecture_09.md)
