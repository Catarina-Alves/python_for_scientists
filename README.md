> Python for Scientists and Engineers

Software is the tool of the modern world. The great thing about software is that it is so general a tool that is used almost everywhere. A person who masters a language or two has the ability to truly do what they want. For many scientists and engineers, software has become *the* tool and Python has become *the* language.

### What This Class is

The purpose of this class is to provide an introduction to the Python language in general and more specifically to Python libraries used every day by scientists and engineers.

### What This Class is Not

This class does not cover the deep mysteries of software, nor does it attempt to give a solid review of computer science theory. For more on those topics, see [these](http://amzn.com/0262510871) [three](http://amzn.com/0262033844
